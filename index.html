 <h1>The History Of The Black Battalion</h1>
      <p1> The Black Battalion was formed in Pictou, Nova Scotia. It was the first black battalion in Canadian history. Recruitment took place across Canada but most signed up from the Maritimes. It was difficult for people of colour to enlist because of the racism they had to face by the most people who were in charge of military enlistment. The Black Battalionâ€™s chaplain was Reverend William White, who had also played a leading role getting the unit formed. They preformed non combat support roles.In addition to the men of the Black Battalion, an estimated 2,000 Black Canadians, such as James Grant, Roy Fells, Seymour Tyler, Jeremiah Jones and Curly Christian, were determined to get to the front lines and managed to join regular units, going on to give distinguished service that earned some of them medals for bravery.</p>
