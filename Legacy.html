  <h1>The Legacy Left By The Black Battalion</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>As a group they fought racism and discrimination</li>
  <li>When most soldiers returned home as heroes, the men who served in the Black Battalion were not given recognition only decades later</li>
  <li>On 12 November 1982, Senator Calvin W. Ruck and the Black Cultural Society of Nova Scotia hosted a recognition and reunion banquet held at the Lord Nelson Hotel in Halifax for nine Black veterans of the First World War</li>
  <li>It was Canada's first and only segregated military unit</li>
  <li>Ruck's father, the late Senator Calvin Ruck, is credited for bringing the battalion's untold story to the forefront when he wrote a book about their struggles. Douglas Ruck continues to act as a public speaker, championing their accomplishments</li>
  <li>Saturday, March 25th 2017 marks the 100th anniversary of the battalionâ€™s departure to Europe</li>
  <li>Family members and community leaders will gather at Pier 21 in Halifax on the night of the 25th to mark the anniversary</li>
